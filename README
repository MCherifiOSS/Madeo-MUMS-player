This is a Meego unified multimedia service player. Uplayer. This player
is made to work with the Intel CE devices on MeeGo and gst-fluendo-ismd
GStreamer plugins. This player however does not require gst-fluendo-ismd
and will work with autovideosink and software decoders if these are
available.

Note that some API options such as 'set_gdl_plane' will only work if
using gst-fluendo-ismd plugins.

Note by default this is meant to be run as a daemon and will log to
/tmp/uplayer by default
